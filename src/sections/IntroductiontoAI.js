          Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that
          can potentially transform various industries, including finance and
          Cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional programming, ML algorithms enable
          computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task by
          processing and making predictions or decisions based on that data. The
          more data the algorithm is trained on, the more accurate its
          predictions become.{" "}

        <p className="custom-caption-text text-gray-800 mb-3">
          AI and ML have already significantly impacted many industries by
          enabling machines to perform tasks that were once considered exclusive
          to humans, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and creativity.
          ML is used in various applications, including image and speech
          recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, and
          autonomous driving. However, the rapid growth of AI and ML also raises
          important ethical, social, and economic questions that must be
          addressed.
